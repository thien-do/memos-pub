### Why

Many great ideas don't meet the world because publishing them is still too hard.
You either need to put in huge effort to set up a blog on your own, or write on
commercial platforms that try their best to lock you in. We believe you, and
your ideas, deserve better.

With memos-pub.thien.do, you can just write. We will do the rest to get you a blog. You
don't need to sign up, or configure, or give us your content. In fact, you don't
need to do a thing. We use what you already have in public, and professionally
present them for you. You already have a blog.
